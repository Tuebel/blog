# Introduction
Having my ground truth CV on LinkedIn seems a bit unsatisfactory.
Even though LinkedIn is unlikely to disappear, there is always a risk of hitting a paywall.
Here, I can keep it up-to-date and accessible to everyone.
For hobbies: just keep digging through my blog posts.

# Profile
For over ten years, I have been working with great enthusiasm on automation solutions in the fields of medical robotics, mobility and navigation.
My enthusiasm, openness and resilience have enabled me to successfully complete a large number of projects.
I enjoy taking on responsibility, which I have been able to do in various management positions.
My superiors appreciate my quick thinking and structured problem solving, even under high pressure.
My colleagues appreciate my open communication and the fact that I always have their backs to enable them to work effectively.
With me, you can gain a conscientious, responsible and collegial employee who wants to continuously improve himself and your company.
