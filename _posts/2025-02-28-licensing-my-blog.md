I have seen [this](https://werd.social/@ben/113985690844451474) post by Ben Werdmuller about licensing his blog, so other people can translate his work.
My blog is quite young, so I don't see this happening to me anytime soon.
I want people to use my work without having to ask for permission.
Therefore, I added a LICENSE [page](/_pages/LICENSE.html) and a note to the footer so it is clear to the public.
