# Introduction
Having my ground truth CV on LinkedIn seems a bit unsatisfactory.
Even though LinkedIn is unlikely to disappear, there is always a risk of hitting a paywall.
[Here](https://cv.redick.cc), I can keep it up-to-date and accessible to everyone using a nice Jekyll template.

For a longer, less formal version with more personal insights, check out [My Story](/my_story).

For hobbies: just keep digging through my blog posts.
