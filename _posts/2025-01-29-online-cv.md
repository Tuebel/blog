Recently, it seems that large tech companies are becoming more impulsive with their products and policies.
This encouraged me to own my online presence and foster it.
LinkedIn has been my notebook for my CV, but the recent events have made it quite unsatisfactory that I don't own that data.
Even though LinkedIn is unlikely to disappear, there is always a risk of hitting a paywall.

So I created an [https://cv.redick.cc](online CV), based on a nice [Jekyll template](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv) which I could host anywhere.

Moreover, I wrote an informal long version of [my story](/my_story).

For hobbies: just keep digging through my blog posts.
