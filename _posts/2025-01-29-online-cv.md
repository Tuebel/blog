I've been using LinkedIn as a digital resume, but recent developments have made me uneasy about not owning that data.
It seems like major tech companies are getting more unpredictable with their products and policies.
Even though it's unlikely that LinkedIn will vanish, there's always the risk of encountering a paywall.
This has motivated me to take control of my online presence and nurture it myself.

I created my [https://cv.redick.cc](online CV) based on a nice [Jekyll template](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv).
If I lose access to the LinkedIn CV, I can take this CV with me and host it anywhere.
Still, I'll keep my LinkedIn profile updated, since it is convenient for recruiters and other people on the platform.

Moreover, I wrote an informal, long version of [my story](/my_story).\
For hobbies: just keep digging through my blog posts.

I am **<u>seeking for a new job</u>**, starting in **<u>September 2025</u>**.\
My interests are in **software engineering for robotics, simulations, and machine learning**.
Furthermore, I like **taking responsibility for a team** and helping them grow.
